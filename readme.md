# üìö BookNook - A Bookstore & Caf√© API
*This was intended as a group project for 3-5 people (DataCraft School), 
but I had some free time and didn't understand much about APIs, so I used this as a learning-by-doing experience.*
 
A RESTful API for managing products in a bookstore (books, e-books, movies) and caf√© orders, built with FastAPI and SQLite. This was supposed to be a german data school project for up to 5 people. But I had some free time and didn't understand much about APIs, so I used this as a learning-by-doing-chance.
